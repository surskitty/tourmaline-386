# Pokémon Tourmaline

This is a romhack of Pokémon Emerald, based off [the disassembly by pret et al.](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald)

## Changes So Far
- *All trainer battles are double battles.*
- Move tutors are now infinite use.
- You and your rival both receive an Eevee early in the game, to enable more double battles!
- The PC from the start contains one Master Ball.  Use it well.
- The physical/special split has been implemented.
- Synchronise now always takes effect outside of battle.

## Longer Term Goals
- Fairy type.
- Revamping all Pokemon movesets to be more pleasing to use.
- Expanded encounters.
- Expanded trainer rosters.
- Revamped sprites.
- Infinite use TMs.
- Remove the entire concept of HMs.
