# Pokémon Tourmaline

This is a romhack of Pokémon Emerald, based off [the disassembly by pret et al.](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald)

## Changes So Far
- *All trainer battles are double battles.*
- Move tutors are now infinite use.
- All levelup movesets have been redone for ease of use.
- Faster egg hatching and important tutor moves as egg moves.
- Expanded encounters.
- The PC from the start contains one Master Ball.  Use it well.
- The physical/special split has been implemented.
- Infinite use TMs.
- Synchronise now always takes effect outside of battle.
- Roserade is now a sun stone evolution. Espeon and Umbreon are also stone evolutions. Trade evolutions have been simplified.
- Mirage Island actually shows up.
- Berry trees are now to gen 7 standards.

## Longer Term Goals
- Fairy type.
- Expanded trainer rosters.
- Revamped sprites.
- Remove the entire concept of HMs.

## Credits
- Everyone at pret, obviously.

- The nosepass sprites are by bluwiikoon.
- The lugia sprites are by Chibi Pika.
- Thousand Roads discord server for cheerleading, playtesting, et al.
