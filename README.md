# Pokémon Tourmaline

This is a romhack of Pokémon Emerald, based off [the disassembly by pret et al.](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald)

## What's the idea here?
- All trainer battles are double battles! To accomodate this, you also get a second starter when you 
- Better movesets, wider encounters, the physical/special split, infinite use TMs -- many of the quality of life improvements from later games are here.

## Minor Details
- The PC from the start contains one Master Ball.  Use it well.
- Move tutors are now infinite use.
- Eggs hatch much faster, and some tutor moves are now egg moves.  Egg moves can also be inherited by both parents: hurray, chain breeding!
- The capslock fetish from the original game is gone.
- Synchronise now always takes effect outside of battle.
- Roserade is now a sun stone evolution. Espeon and Umbreon are also stone evolutions. Trade evolutions have been simplified.
- Mirage Island actually shows up.
- Berry trees are now to gen 7 standards.
- Fishing no longer randomly fails to catch a fish.
- Friendship raises faster.
- Mystic Ticket is available.
- Premier Balls are now obtained in bulk with any pokeball purchase.

## Short Term Goals
- Make available the events for Deoxys, the other Eon, and Mew.
- Design events for the legendary birds and beasts.

## Longer Term Goals
- Fairy type.
- More revamped sprites.
- Remove the entire concept of HMs.
- Modernise experience and rebalance levels.
- Simplify map design.
